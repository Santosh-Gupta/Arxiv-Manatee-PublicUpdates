This is the public repo we're going to be using to post updates on Arxiv-Manatee, which are going to be tools for searching through Arxiv-Sanity papers. 

If you would like be involved, feel free to reach out to Research2Vec@gmail.com. We could use those with experience with Tensorflow/Keras/Pytorch, 
NLP, abtractive summarization, and text/data processing, but we're open to considering anyone!
